                <li><b> 1945 </b>- Discovers a way to grow wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields. </li>
                <li><b> 1953 </b>- Crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breedof wheat with a high-yeilding American breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat</li>
